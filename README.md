  ## Introduction
  
  ## Technologies and Libraries
  ### Main Platform
  * Python 3.7.2
    
  ### Internal Libraries
  These libraries are native to Python and should not need to be installed in order to run the scripts. The questions that the libraries areneeded for is listed after the library name.
  * Datetime - Q. 2, 8
  * Math - Q. 7 
  * Os - Q. 9
  * Random - Q. 9
  * String - Q. 6
  * Sys - Q. 9
  * Time - Q. 9
  
  ### External libraries
  These are libraries that are not normally part of the standard installation with Python, and will need to be installed prior to running some of these scripts. The questions that the libraries are needed for is listed after the library name.
  * Matplotlib.pyplot - Q. 10
  * NumPy - Q. 10
  
  ## Setup
  
  
  
  ## Research
  Two separate types of research were carried out in order to solve the problems posed. These were:
  
  * Problem solving research
  * Code formatting research
    
  ### Problem solving research
  All research with regards to problem solving was treated as a thought exercise. As such, all problems, solutions, processes, and code logic was created from the author's own mind. The exception to this was the application of logic (Q.7, lines 103 & 104) for the Newton-Raphson method, which were sourced from various sites including:
  
  1. <a href="https://medium.com/code-zen/newtons-square-root-d8be94ec641e">Joe Chasinga's Medium post</a>
  2. <a href="http://www.sosmath.com/calculus/diff/der07/der07.html">Netwon-Raphson Method</a>
 
  As the problems are fairly common problems, in terms of processes, and logic, there may be some overlap between the logic shown in the author's solutions, and existing information available on the web.
  
  ### Code formatting research
  This research involved identifying how to write a particular code sequence, in order to implement the solution that was implemented. The following sources were used for code research:
  
  * <a href="https://www.w3schools.com">W3Schools</a>, 
  * <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.7/library/index.html">Official Python 3.7.2 documentation</a>
  * <a href="https://matplotlib.org/contents.html">Matplotlib</a>
  * <a href="https://docs.scipy.org/doc">NumPy</a>

 For Question 6 (the 2nd word problem), two additional sources were used as the basis of the solution. These were:
  * <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/17645629/4430536">user2357112's answer from StackOverflow</a>
  * <a href="https://www.dotnetperls.com/punctuation-python">Sam Allen's Instance Search page</a>
 
  ## Questions Asked
  The following questions were asked, and answered, in the Python scripts in this repository:
  
  1. Write a program that asks the user to input any positive integer and outputs the sum of all numbers between one and that number.
  2. Write a program that outputs whether or not today is a day that begins with the letter T.
  3. Write a program that prints all numbers between 1,000 and 10,000 that are divisible by 6 but not 12.
  4. Write a program that asks the user to input any positive integer and outputs the successive values of the following calculation. At each step calculate the next value by taking the current value and, if it is even, divide it by two, but if it is odd, multiply it by three and add one. Have the program end if the current value is one.
  5. Write a program that asks the user to input a positive integer and tells the user whether or not the number is a prime.
  6. Write a program that takes a user input string and outputs every second word.
  7. Write a program that that takes a positive floating point number as input and outputs an approximation of its square root.
  8. Write a program that outputs today’s date and time in the format “Monday, January 10th 2019 at 1:15pm”.
  9. Write a program that reads in a text file and outputs every second line. The program should take the filename from an argument on the command line.
  10. Write a program that displays a plot of the functions x, x2 and 2x in the range [0, 4].
  
  ## Code Examples
  
  ## Status
  The status of this project is complete. As these is a submission date of the 31st March, 2019, the files will be altered, from their current format, after that date. Where the last push/alter date is prior to the 31st March, 2019, that date can be viewed as the completion date.
